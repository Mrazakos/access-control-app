# Decentralized Access Control Mobile Application

A React Native mobile application implementing blockchain-based access control using Verifiable Credentials (W3C VC 2.0) and Ethereum smart contracts. This project is part of a thesis on decentralized access control systems.

## 🎓 Thesis Project

This application demonstrates a practical implementation of decentralized access control for physical locks, combining:

- **W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0** for credential issuance and verification
- **Ethereum blockchain** for lock registration and credential revocation
- **ECDSA cryptography** for off-chain and on-chain credential signing
- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile access

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Key Components

1. **Lock Management**

   - Create and register smart locks on the blockchain
   - Each lock has its own cryptographic identity (ECDSA key pair + Ethereum address)
   - Locks are registered on-chain with their unique addresses

2. **Verifiable Credentials System**

   - **Off-chain Issuance**: Lock owners issue W3C-compliant VCs to grant access
   - **Privacy-Preserving**: User metadata is hashed before inclusion in credentials
   - **QR Code Sharing**: Credentials are shared via time-limited QR codes (10-minute expiry)
   - **On-chain Revocation**: Credentials are revoked by sending hash + signature to smart contract

3. **Dual Credential Storage**
   - **Issued Credentials**: Stored by lock owners with full user metadata
   - **Access Credentials**: Stored by recipients with only metadata hash (privacy)

### Architecture Flow

│  Lock Owner     │
│  (Issuer)       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ 1. Create Lock (generates identity)
         │ 2. Register on Blockchain

└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         │ 3. Issue VC (off-chain)
         │ 4. Generate QR Code

         │ 5. Scan QR Code

         │ 7. Use for Access

## 🔐 Cryptographic Design

### Off-chain vs On-chain Signatures

1. **Off-chain Credentials** (for lock verification):

   - Signed with standard ECDSA (secp256k1)
   - Verified using public key
   - Used for physical lock access

2. **On-chain Credentials** (for smart contract verification):
   - Signed with Ethereum message prefix (`\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n`)
   - Verified using `ecrecover` in smart contract
   - Used for blockchain-based revocation

### Credential Hash Consistency

The VC hash remains **identical** between off-chain and on-chain versions:

- Only the **signature format** changes
- Ensures the same credential can be verified in both contexts
- Critical for revocation: off-chain VC hash matches on-chain revocation record

## 📱 Features

### Lock Owner Features

- ✅ Create and register smart locks on blockchain
- ✅ Issue W3C Verifiable Credentials to users

### User Features

- ✅ Receive credentials via QR code scanning
- ✅ Store credentials locally (privacy-preserving)
- ✅ View credential details and expiration dates
- ✅ Use credentials to unlock doors (NFC/Bluetooth - TODO)
- ✅ Search and filter credentials by lock

### Smart Contract Testing

See the smart contract repository for Hardhat testing setup.

## 📖 W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0

This project implements the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specification.

### Credential Structure

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "LockAccessCredential"],
  "id": "vc:uuid-here",
  "issuer": {
    "id": "did:lock:123",
    "name": "Main Entrance Lock"
  },
  "validFrom": "2025-11-03T10:00:00Z",
  "validUntil": "2025-12-03T10:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:user:abc123",
    "userMetaDataHash": "0x...",
    "lock": {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Main Entrance"
    },
    "accessLevel": "standard",
    "permissions": ["unlock"]
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
    "created": "2025-11-03T10:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:lock:123#key-1",
    "proofValue": "0x..."
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Privacy

- User metadata (email, name) is **hashed** before inclusion in credentials
- Only credential holder and issuer know the actual user information
- Credentials can be verified without revealing user identity

### Key Management

- Each lock has its own ECDSA key pair
- Private keys stored securely in device's encrypted storage
- Never transmitted over network

### Revocation

- Revoked credentials are recorded on-chain
- Immutable revocation registry
- Physical locks can check revocation status before granting access

### QR Code Security

- Time-limited (10-minute expiry)
- One-time use recommended
- Contains full credential for offline verification

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] **NFC Communication** for physical lock interaction
- [ ] **Bluetooth** for wireless unlock
- [ ] **Biometric Authentication** for credential access
- [ ] **Multi-signature** for high-security locks
- [ ] **Delegation** - Allow credential holders to delegate access
- [ ] **Time-based Access Control** - Restrict access to specific time windows
- [ ] **Audit Logs** - Track all access attempts
- [ ] **Credential Refresh** - Automatic renewal of expiring credentials
